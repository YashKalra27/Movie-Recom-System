## 🚀 Overview

In the age of endless movie choices, decision fatigue is real. This project solves that problem by recommending movies similar to the one you like, using a custom NLP pipeline that creates a content-based similarity matrix.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Users often struggle to pick their next movie. Generic lists don’t adapt to unique tastes. This system empowers users to find new titles aligned with their preferences, using metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and plot overview.

---

## 🧩 Solution Approach

**1. Data Preparation**

- Datasets: `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` from The Movie Database (TMDB).
- Merged datasets on `title` to unify movie metadata.

**2. Feature Engineering**

- Selected relevant features: `genres`, `keywords`, `cast` (top 3 actors), `crew` (director only), and `overview`.
- Cleaned nested JSON fields using `ast.literal_eval`.
- Normalized text data: removed spaces in multi-word tokens, combined all features into a single `tags` column.

**3. NLP Pipeline**

- Stemming applied using `PorterStemmer`.
- Converted text to lowercase.
- Vectorized text data with `CountVectorizer` (5000 max features, English stopwords removed).

**4. Similarity Matrix**

- Calculated pairwise cosine similarity.
- Stored results using `pickle` for production use.

**5. Frontend & Deployment**

- **Streamlit** app with an interactive dropdown.
- Fetches movie posters dynamically from TMDB API.
- Deployed seamlessly on **Render** for public access.
